**Topics:** A demonstrative computer session using ADINA - nonlinear analysis

*   Use of ADINA for elastic-plastic analysis of a plate with a hole
*   Computer laboratory demonstration - Part II
*   Selection of solution parameters and input data preparation
*   Study of the effect of using different kinematic assumptions (small or large strains) in the finite element solution
*   Effect of a shaft in the plate hole, assuming frictionless contact
*   Effect of expanding shaft
*   Study and evaluation of solution results

**Instructor:** Klaus-JÃ¼rgen Bathe
