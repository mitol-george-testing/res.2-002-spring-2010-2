*   Basic procedure of direct integration
*   The explicit central difference method, basic equations, details of computations performed, stability considerations, time step selection, relation of critical time step size to wave speed, modeling of problems
*   Practical observations regarding use of the central difference method
*   The implicit trapezoidal rule, basic equations, details of computations performed, time step selection, convergence of iterations, modeling of problems
*   Practical observations regarding use of the trapezoidal rule
*   Combination of explicit and implicit integrations
