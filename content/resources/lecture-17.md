**Topics:** Modeling of elasto-plastic and creep response I

*   Basic considerations in modeling inelastic response
*   A schematic review of laboratory test results, effects of stress level, temperature, strain rate
*   One-dimensional stress-strain laws for elasto-plasticity, creep, and viscoplasticity
*   Isotropic and kinematic hardening in plasticity
*   General equations of multiaxial plasticity based on a yield condition, flow rule, and hardening rule
*   Example of von Mises yield condition and isotropic hardening, evaluation of stress-strain law for general analysis
*   Use of plastic work, effective stress, effective plastic strain
*   Integration of stresses with subincrementation
*   Example analysis: Plane strain punch problem
*   Example analysis: Elasto-plastic response up to ultimate load of a plate with a hole
*   Computer-plotted animation: Plate with a hole
