**Topics:** Total Lagrangian formulation for incremental general nonlinear analysis

*   Review of basic principle of virtual work equation, objective in incremental solution
*   Incremental stress and strain decompositions in the total Lagrangian form of the principle of virtual work
*   Linear and nonlinear strain increments
*   Initial displacement effect
*   Considerations for finite element discretization with continuum elements (isoparametric solids with translational degrees of freedom only) and structural elements (with translational and rotational degrees of freedom)
*   Consistent linearization of terms in the principle of virtual work for the incremental solution
*   The "out-of-balance" virtual work term
*   Derivation of iterative equations
*   The modified Newton-Raphson iteration, flowchart of complete solution
