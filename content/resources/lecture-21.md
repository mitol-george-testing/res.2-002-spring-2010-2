**Topics:** A demonstrative computer session using ADINA - linear analysis

*   Use of the computer program ADINA for finite element analysis, discussion of data preparation, program solution, and display of results
*   Capabilities of ADINA
*   Computer laboratory demonstration - Part I
*   Linear analysis of a plate with a hole for the stress concentration factor
*   Data input preparation and mesh generation
*   Solution of the model
*   Study and evaluation of results using plots of stresses, stress jumps, and pressure bands

**Instructor:** Klaus-JÃ¼rgen Bathe
