**Topics:** Implementation of methods in computer programs; examples SAP, ADINA

*   Implementation of the finite element method
*   The computer programs SAP and ADINA
*   Details of allocation of nodal point degrees of freedom, calculation of matrices, the assemblage process
*   Example analysis of a cantilever plate
*   Out-of-core solution
*   Effective nodal-point numbering
*   Flow chart of total solution process
*   Introduction to different effective finite elements used in one-, two-, three-dimensional, beam, plate, and shell analyses
