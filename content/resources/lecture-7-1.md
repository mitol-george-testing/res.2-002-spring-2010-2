**Topics:** Two- and three-dimensional solid elements; plane stress, plane strain, and axisymmetric conditions

*   Isoparametric interpolations of coordinates and displacements
*   Consistency between coordinate and displacement interpolations
*   Meaning of these interpolations in large displacement analysis, motion of a material particle
*   Evaluation of required derivatives
*   The Jacobian transformations
*   Details of strain-displacement matrices for total and updated Lagrangian formulations
*   Example of 4-node two-dimensional element, details of matrices used

**Instructor:** Klaus-JÃ¼rgen Bathe
