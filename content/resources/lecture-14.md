**Topics:** Solution of nonlinear dynamic response II

*   Mode superposition analysis in nonlinear dynamics
*   Substructuring in nonlinear dynamics, a schematic example of a building on a flexible foundation
*   Study of analyses to demonstrate characteristics of procedures for nonlinear dynamic solutions
*   Example analysis: Wave propagation in a rod
*   Example analysis: Dynamic response of a three degree-of-freedom system using the central difference method
*   Example analysis: Ten-story tapered tower subjected to blast loading
*   Example analysis: Simple pendulum undergoing large displacements
*   Example analysis: Pipe whip solution
*   Example analysis: Control rod drive housing with lower support
*   Example analysis: Spherical cap under uniform pressure loading
*   Example analysis: Solution of fluid-structure interaction problem
