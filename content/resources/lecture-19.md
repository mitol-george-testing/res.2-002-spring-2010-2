**Topics:** Beam, plate, and shell elements I

*   Brief review of major formulation approaches
*   The degeneration of a three-dimensional continuum to beam and shell behavior
*   Basic kinematic and static assumptions used
*   Formulation of isoparametric (degenerate) general shell elements of variable thickness for large displacements and rotations
*   Geometry and displacement interpolations
*   The nodal director vectors
*   Use of five or six nodal point degrees of freedom, theoretical considerations and practical use
*   The stress-strain law in shell analysis, transformations used at shell element integration points
*   Shell transition elements, modeling of transition zones between solids and shells, shell intersections

**Instructor:** Klaus-JÃ¼rgen Bathe
