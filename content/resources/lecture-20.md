**Topics:** Beam, plate, and shell elements II

*   Formulation of isoparametric (degenerate) beam elements for large displacements and rotations
*   A rectangular cross-section beam element of variable thickness; coordinate and displacement interpolations
*   Use of the nodal director vectors
*   The stress-strain law
*   Introduction of warping displacements
*   Example analysis: 180 degrees, large displacement twisting of a ring
*   Example analysis: Torsion of an elastic-plastic cross-section
*   Recommendations for the use of isoparametric beam and shell elements
*   The phenomena of shear and membrane locking as observed for certain elements
*   Study of solutions of straight and curved cantilevers modeled using various elements
*   An effective 4-node shell element (the MITC4 element) for analysis of general shells
*   The patch test, theoretical and practical considerations
*   Example analysis: Solution of a three-dimensional spherical shell
*   Example analysis: Solution of an open box
*   Example analysis: Solution of a square plate, including use of distorted elements
*   Example analysis: Solution of a 30-degree skew plate
*   Example analysis: Large displacement solution of a cantilever
*   Example analysis: Collapse analysis of an I-beam in torsion
*   Example analysis: Collapse analysis of a cylindrical shell
