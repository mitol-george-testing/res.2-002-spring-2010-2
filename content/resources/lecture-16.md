**Topics:** Use of elastic constitutive relations in updated Lagrangian formulation

*   Use of updated Lagrangian (U.L.) formulation
*   Detailed comparison of expressions used in total Lagrangian (T.L.) and U.L. formulations; strains, stresses, and constitutive relations
*   Study of conditions to obtain in a general incremental analysis the same results as in the T.L. formulation, and vice versa
*   The special case of elasticity
*   The Almansi strain tensor
*   One-dimensional example involving large strains
*   Analysis of large displacement/small strain problems
*   Example analysis: Large displacement solution of frame using updated and total Lagrangian formulations
