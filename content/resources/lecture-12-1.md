**Topics:** Demonstrative example solutions in static analysis

*   Analysis of various problems to demonstrate, study, and evaluate solution methods in statics
*   Example analysis: Snap-through of an arch
*   Example analysis: Collapse analysis of an elastic-plastic cylinder
*   Example analysis: Large displacement response of a shell
*   Example analysis: Large displacements of a cantilever subjected to deformation-independent and deformation-dependent loading
*   Example analysis: Large displacement response of a diamond-shaped frame
*   Computer-plotted animation: Diamond-shaped frame
*   Example analysis: Failure and repair of a beam/cable structure
