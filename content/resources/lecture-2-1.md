**Topics:** Basic considerations in nonlinear analysis

*   The principle of virtual work in general nonlinear analysis, including all material and geometric nonlinearities
*   A simple instructive example
*   Introduction to the finite element incremental solution, statement and physical explanation of governing finite element equations
*   Requirements of equilibrium, compatibility, and the stress-strain law
*   Nodal point equilibrium versus local equilibrium
*   Assessment of accuracy of a solution
*   Example analysis: Stress concentration factor calculation for a plate with a hole in tension
*   Example analysis: Fracture mechanics stress intensity factor calculation for a plate with an eccentric crack in tension
*   Discussion of mesh evaluation by studying stress jumps along element boundaries and pressure band plots
