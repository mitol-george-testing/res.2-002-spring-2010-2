**Topics:** The two-noded truss element - total Lagrangian formulation

*   Derivation of total Lagrangian truss element displacement and strain-displacement matrices from continuum mechanics equations
*   Mathematical and physical explanation that only one component of the 2nd Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor is nonzero
*   Physical explanation of the matrices obtained directly by application of the principle of virtual work
*   Discussion of initial displacement effect
*   Comparison of updated and total Lagrangian formulations
*   Example analysis: Collapse of a truss structure
*   Example analysis: Large displacements of a cable

**Instructor:** Klaus-JÃ¼rgen Bathe
