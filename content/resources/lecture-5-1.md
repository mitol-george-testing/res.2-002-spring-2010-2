**Topics:** Updated Lagrangian formulation for incremental general nonlinear analysis

*   Principle of virtual work in terms of 2nd Piola-Kirchhoff stresses and Green-Lagrange strains referred to the configuration at time t
*   Incremental stress and strain decompositions in the updated Lagrangian form of the principle of virtual work
*   Linear and nonlinear strain increments
*   Consistent linearization of terms in the principle of virtual work
*   The "out-of-balance" virtual work term
*   Iterative equations for modified Newton-Raphson solution
*   Flowchart of complete solution
*   Comparison to total Lagrangian formulation

**Instructor:** Klaus-JÃ¼rgen Bathe
